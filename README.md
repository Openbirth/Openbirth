# Openbirth

Openbirth is an open-source "Binding of Isaac" clone made in C++ with raylib. The idea is to have something extremely similar to "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth" but in C++ and with more customizability options. Basically, this project is an Isaac-style game engine.

## Why though?

"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth" uses Lua for mods, and isn't open source. Openbirth uses C++ and is open source. There really is no reason for this project other than "screw Lua" and "I love Isaac". 

## Status of the project:
- Afterbirth+ Mod Compatibility: 0%
- Repentance Mod Compatibility: 0%
- Ready to play: No.

Please note that Openbirth is a WIP.
